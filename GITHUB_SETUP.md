# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through creating the GitHub repository and setting up all the issues for the Plastic Crack MVP.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and sign in to your account
2. **Click "New repository"** or go to https://github.com/new
3. **Repository settings:**
   - Repository name: `plastic-crack`
   - Description: `Cross-platform miniature wargaming collection management app with AI-powered features and social community`
   - Visibility: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - âœ… Initialize with README (uncheck this - we already have one)
   - âœ… Add .gitignore: None (we already have one)
   - âœ… Choose a license: MIT License (recommended)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\DavidMorgan-_ikyj\Documents\Plastic Crack"
git remote add origin https://github.com/DaiGumms/plastic-crack.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Set Up Repository Labels

Create these labels in your repository (Settings â†’ Labels):

### Priority Labels
- `priority:high` - #d93f0b (red)
- `priority:medium` - #fbca04 (yellow) 
- `priority:low` - #0e8a16 (green)

### Type Labels
- `epic` - #7057ff (purple)
- `backend` - #1d76db (blue)
- `frontend` - #1d76db (blue)
- `mobile` - #1d76db (blue)
- `database` - #006b75 (teal)
- `api` - #0052cc (dark blue)
- `ui` - #e99695 (light red)
- `auth` - #f9d0c4 (light orange)
- `testing` - #c2e0c6 (light green)
- `devops` - #5319e7 (dark purple)
- `documentation` - #0075ca (blue)
- `security` - #b60205 (dark red)
- `performance` - #fbca04 (yellow)
- `setup` - #d4c5f9 (light purple)

### Status Labels
- `good-first-issue` - #7057ff (purple)
- `help-wanted` - #008672 (teal)
- `enhancement` - #a2eeef (light blue)
- `bug` - #d73a4a (red)

## Step 4: Create GitHub Issues

Now you'll create all 43 issues from the `MVP_ISSUES.md` file. Here's how to create them efficiently:

### Batch Issue Creation Process

1. **Open your repository** on GitHub
2. **Go to Issues tab** and click "New issue"
3. **For each issue in MVP_ISSUES.md:**
   
   **Copy the content structure like this:**

   **Title:** `[EPIC] Project Setup and Development Infrastructure`
   
   **Labels:** Add the appropriate labels (epic, infrastructure, setup, priority:high)
   
   **Description:** Copy the full description from MVP_ISSUES.md including:
   - Description
   - Tasks/Acceptance Criteria
   - Dependencies (if any)

### Example: First Issue

**Title:** `[EPIC] Project Setup and Development Infrastructure`

**Labels:** `epic`, `setup`, `infrastructure`, `priority:high`

**Description:**
```
Set up the foundational infrastructure for the Plastic Crack application including monorepo structure, CI/CD, and development environment.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create monorepo structure with workspaces
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure Docker containers for development
- [ ] Set up environment variable management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Tests passing
```

## Step 5: Create Issues in Order

Create the issues in this order for best workflow:

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Issues 1-7)
1. [EPIC] Project Setup and Development Infrastructure
2. [BACKEND] Set up Express.js API with TypeScript  
3. [DATABASE] PostgreSQL setup with Prisma ORM
4. [CACHE] Redis integration for caching and sessions
5. [AUTH] JWT-based authentication system
6. [USER] User profile CRUD operations
7. [AUTH] Role-based authorization middleware

### Phase 2 - Core Features (Issues 8-22)
Continue with mobile app setup, web app setup, and collection management features...

### Phase 3 - Enhanced Features (Issues 23-32)
Image management, search, and price tracking features...

### Phase 4 - Quality & Launch (Issues 33-43)
Testing, optimization, and launch preparation...

## Step 6: Set Up Milestones

Create these milestones in GitHub (Issues â†’ Milestones):

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Due: 2 weeks from start)
   - Description: "Basic infrastructure, authentication, and project setup"
   - Issues: #1-7

2. **Phase 2: Core Features** (Due: 6 weeks from start)
   - Description: "Mobile and web applications with collection management"
   - Issues: #8-22

3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Features** (Due: 8 weeks from start)
   - Description: "Image management, search, and price tracking"
   - Issues: #23-32

4. **Phase 4: Launch Preparation** (Due: 10 weeks from start)
   - Description: "Testing, optimization, and MVP launch"
   - Issues: #33-43

## Step 7: Assign Issues to Milestones

After creating all issues, go back and assign each issue to its appropriate milestone.

## Step 8: Set Up Project Board (Optional)

1. **Go to Projects tab** in your repository
2. **Create new project** (use the new Projects beta)
3. **Add columns:**
   - Backlog
   - Todo
   - In Progress
   - In Review
   - Done

4. **Add all issues** to the Backlog column

## Step 9: Configure Repository Settings

### Branch Protection
1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add branch protection rule for `main`:
   - âœ… Require pull request reviews before merging
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
   - âœ… Restrict pushes to matching branches

### Security Settings
1. Go to Settings â†’ Security & analysis
2. Enable:
   - âœ… Dependency graph
   - âœ… Dependabot alerts
   - âœ… Dependabot security updates

## Step 10: Update Package.json

Update the repository URLs in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/DaiGumms/plastic-crack.git"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/DaiGumms/plastic-crack/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/DaiGumms/plastic-crack#readme"
}
```

Then commit and push the changes:

```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Update repository URLs in package.json"
git push origin main
```

## Step 11: Invite Collaborators (Optional)

If you're working with a team:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Collaborators
2. Add team members with appropriate permissions

## Automation Tips

### Using GitHub CLI (Optional)
If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create issues faster:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first: https://cli.github.com/

# Create an issue
gh issue create --title "[EPIC] Project Setup" --body-file issue-template.md --label "epic,setup"
```

### Issue Templates
The issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` will automatically show up when creating new issues, making it easier for contributors to report bugs or request features.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create the GitHub repository
2. âœ… Push your local code
3. âœ… Set up labels and milestones  
4. âœ… Create all 43 issues
5. âœ… Set up project board
6. âœ… Configure repository settings
7. ðŸš€ Start development with Issue #1!
