## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Upload Types Used

- **Avatar**: `uploadType="avatar"` - Single file, no additional IDs required
- **Collection Thumbnail**: `uploadType="collection-thumbnail"` - Batch upload, requires
  `collectionId`
- **Model Images**: `uploadType="model-image"` - Batch upload, requires `collectionId` and `modelId`

### Component Integration Patterns

#### 1. **Dialog-Based Upload (UserProfilePage)**

```tsx
<UploadDialog
  open={avatarDialogOpen}
  onClose={() => setAvatarDialogOpen(false)}
  uploadType='avatar'
  onUploadComplete={handleAvatarUploadComplete}
  onUploadError={handleAvatarUploadError}
/>
```

#### 2. **Form Field Integration (CollectionForm)**

```tsx
<ImageInput
  value={field.value}
  onChange={field.onChange}
  label='Cover Image'
  uploadType='collection-thumbnail'
  collectionId={collection?.id}
  error={!!errors.imageUrl}
  helperText={errors.imageUrl?.message}
/>
```

#### 3. **Inline Upload (ModelForm)**

```tsx
<DragDropUpload
  uploadType='model-image'
  variant='dropzone'
  collectionId={watch('collectionId')}
  modelId={model?.id}
  onUploadComplete={handlePhotosUploaded}
  onUploadError={handleUploadError}
/>
```
