## üé® Component Architecture

### ModelCard
- Displays individual model with image, name, status, and metadata
- Click handler for navigation to detail view (future implementation)
- Status indicators with color coding
- Responsive design with consistent styling

### ModelGrid  
- CSS Grid layout (replaced Material-UI Grid for better performance)
- Search functionality by model name
- Multi-filter support (status, game system, collection)
- Pagination with customizable page size
- Empty states and loading indicators

### ModelForm
- Comprehensive form with all model fields
- Section-based layout: Basic Info, Game System, Game Details, Tags, Notes, Settings
- Dynamic faction filtering based on selected game system
- Auto-selection of game system when collection is chosen
- Tag management with add/remove functionality

- **Search & Filter**: Name search with multiple filter options  
- **Pagination**: Server-side pagination support
- **Photo Upload**: File upload endpoint integration
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and response parsing

### Dependencies Added
Required packages for form handling and date picking:
- `yup` - Schema validation
- `@hookform/resolvers` - React Hook Form yup integration  
- `@mui/x-date-pickers` - Material-UI date picker components
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation utilities

## üéØ User Experience

### Navigation
- Added "Models" to main navigation menu
- Quick action buttons on dashboard for easy access
- Breadcrumb-style page organization

### Workflow
1. **Browse Models**: View all models in responsive grid layout
2. **Search & Filter**: Find specific models quickly  
3. **Add New Model**: Comprehensive form with all required fields
